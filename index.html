          <h3>First Element</h3>
          <p>The group band played their first show billed as "the Rollin' Stones" on 12 July 1962, at the Marquee Club in London.[17][18][19][a] At the time, the band consisted of Jones, Jagger, Richards, Stewart, and Taylor.[22] Bill Wyman auditioned for the role of bass guitarist at a pub in Chelsea on 7 December 1962 and was hired as a successor to Dick Taylor. The band were impressed by his instrument and amplifiers (including the Vox AC30).[23] The classic line-up of the Rolling Stones, with Charlie Watts on drums played for the first time in public on Saturday, 12 January 1963 at the Ealing Club.[24] However, it was not until a gig there on 2 February 1963 that Watts became the Stones' permanent drummer.[25]</p>

        <li><h3>Second Element</h3>
          <p>The band's second UK LP, The Rolling Stones No. 2, was released in January 1965 and reached No. 1 on the charts. The US version, released in February as The Rolling Stones, Now!, reached No. 5. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles.[80] In January and February that year the band played 34 shows for around 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand.[81] The single "The Last Time", released in February, was the first Jagger/Richards composition to reach No.</p>

          <h3>Third Element</h3>
          <p>heir first international No. 1 hit was "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", recorded in May 1965 during the band's third North American tour. Richards recorded the guitar riff that drives the song with a fuzzbox as a scratch track to guide a horn section. Nevertheless, the final cut was without the planned horn overdubs. Issued in the summer of 1965, it was their fourth UK No. 1 and their first in the US where it spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. It was a worldwide commercial success for the band.[82][83] The US version of the LP Out of Our Heads, released in July 1965, also went to No 1; it included seven original songs, three Jagger/Richards numbers and four credited to Nanker Phelge.[84] Their second international No. 1 single "Get Off of My Cloud" was released in the autumn  of 1965,[85] followed by another US-only LP, December's Children.[86]</p>
